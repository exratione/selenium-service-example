# This directory holds error pages
# The error pages are the actual content, the header is generated 
# by rabbit internally.

# Each template file should be named by the error code, like "504"
# for the Gateway timeout page.

# Each template may have some tags and strings replaced.
# The following tags may be used for simple transformations:
# <%url%>         expands to the request url 
# <%exception%>   expands to the error message
# <%filename%>    expands to the filename of the wanted file
# <%expectation%> expands to the expectation that failed
# <%realm%>       expands to the authorization realm

# The following tags expand to quite a lot of content:
# <%places%>      expands to a list of alternative url:s
# <%stacktrace%>  expands to the java stack trace

# Inside A-tags and IMG-tags the string "$proxy" may be used
# to refer to the current proxy, similar to how the ad blocking 
# replacement image is most often served.
