Thank you for downloading the TestingBot Tunnel v.1.14
You can find more information about this program on http://testingbot.com/support/other/tunnel

To get started, simply make sure you have java installed.
Then open a command prompt and type: java -jar TestingBot-Tunnel.jar

TIP: if the tunnel is slow for you, consider using the -b argument which should boost performance. This requires rabbit4.jar in the lib/rabbit/jars folder
